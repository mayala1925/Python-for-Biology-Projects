# Problem 2: Gene expression changes upon addition of ecdysone is in the file "rpkm_ecdysone_to_ctl.txt", which has two columns separated by a tab. First column is Gene_name, second column named "Enrichment" is the log2 fold change of expression upon addition of ecdysone. The genes next to enhancers responsive to ecdysone are listed in "w_ecd_genes.list" and the control group is listed in "wo_ecd_genes.list". Make a boxplot of expression change comparing genes next to ecdysone enhancers and genes next to control enhancers
